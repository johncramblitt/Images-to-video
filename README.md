Convert image files from a folder to a timelapse video

This is a simple program to convert a series of images into a timelapse video. Simply create a folder containing the images to be converted into a video and use the filepath associated with that file in the spaces prompted.

A video will be output in the same file in which the images are located.

The number of frames per second can be adjusted as shown in the notebook.
